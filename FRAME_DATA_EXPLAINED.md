# Frame Data FULLY EXPLAINED - For Complete Beginners

## 🎯 Understanding Moves: A Complete Breakdown

This guide explains **EVERYTHING** about frame data, what moves look like, and how to use this information to win.

---

## 📖 Example Move: 5L (Standing Light)

### Move Entry:
```
5L | 12f startup | -2 on block | 45 damage | Close range
```

Let me explain **EVERY SINGLE PART** of this...

---

## 🎬 What Does 5L Look Like?

### Visual Description:

**5L = Standing Light Punch**

**What you see:**
- Blitzcrank is standing (not crouching, not jumping)
- He throws a quick jab/punch with his arm
- Small hitbox (hits close range only)
- Quick animation that looks like a boxing jab
- Hit effect: Small spark/impact when it connects

**Animation:**
```
Normal stance → Arm extends forward → Quick retract → Back to stance
     [0f]            [12f]              [Active]         [Recovery]
```

**Think of it like:** A quick punch in a boxing match. Not heavy, just a fast jab to your opponent's face.

## ⚡ What Does "12f Startup" Mean?

### The Technical Explanation:
**12 frames until the move hits**

### What That ACTUALLY Means:

**Frame = 1/60th of a second** (the game runs at 60 FPS)
- 12 frames = 12/60 second = **0.2 seconds** (one-fifth of a second)

**In Real Time:**
- You press the button (J key)
- 0.2 seconds pass
- The punch becomes active and can hit

### Is 12f Fast or Slow?

**Fighting Game Speed Chart:**
```
3-5f   = SUPER FAST (unreactable)
6-8f   = FAST (hard to react)
9-12f  = MEDIUM (normal speed)
13-20f = SLOW (reactable)
20+f   = VERY SLOW (easy to see coming)
```

**Blitzcrank's 5L at 12f = MEDIUM speed**
- Not super fast, but not slow either
- It's his fastest normal move
- Most characters have 6-8f lights, so Blitz is a bit slower

### Why Does This Matter?

**1. Can you react to opponent's moves?**
If opponent does a 20f move, you can see it coming and press 5L (12f) to hit them first.

**2. Can you punish blocked moves?**
If opponent is -15 on block, you have 15 frames to punish. Your 12f 5L will hit them!

**3. Can you interrupt pressure?**
If there's a gap in opponent's blockstring, 12f might be fast enough to jab out.

---

## 🛡️ What Does "-2 On Block" Mean?

### The Technical Explanation:
**You recover 2 frames AFTER the opponent**

### What That ACTUALLY Means:

**When they block your 5L:**
1. Your move hits their block
2. Both of you are in "blockstun" (frozen briefly)
3. You recover after 12f + recovery time
4. They recover 2 frames BEFORE you do
5. **They get to act first!**

### Frame Advantage Chart:

```
POSITIVE (+2, +5, +10, etc.) = YOU ACT FIRST ✅
  ↓
NEUTRAL (0, -1, -2, -3) = Roughly even ⚖️
  ↓
UNSAFE (-4, -5, -6, etc.) = THEY ACT FIRST ⚠️
  ↓
VERY UNSAFE (-10, -15, -20) = FREE PUNISH FOR THEM ❌
```

### -2 vs -10: The Difference

**-2 On Block (Slightly Unsafe):**
```
You: Press 5L → They block it → You're -2
Them: Can act 2 frames before you

What they can do:
✅ Press their fastest move (6f light) - hits you before your next move
✅ Try to grab you (grabs are ~6-8f)
❌ CANNOT do big combos (too slow to start)
❌ CANNOT do heavy attacks (too slow)

What YOU can do:
✅ Block (safest option)
✅ Backdash (create space)
✅ Press light again (might trade or lose)
❌ Don't press slow buttons (you'll get hit)
```

**-10 On Block (Very Unsafe):**
```
You: Press a slow move → They block it → You're -10
Them: Can act 10 FRAMES before you

What they can do:
✅ Press light (6f) - EASILY hits you
✅ Press medium (10f) - hits you
✅ Press heavy (14f) - might hit if you press button
✅ Start a full combo (guaranteed punish)
✅ Command grab you (100% free)
✅ Launch you into the air

What YOU can do:
❌ Nothing - you're completely stuck
✅ ONLY option: Learn not to do that move without assist!
```

### Real Example:

**Scenario 1: You do 5L (on block), you're -2**
```
[You press 5L] → [They block] → You're -2

Timeline:
Frame 0:   They can act
Frame 2:   You can act
Frame 6:   Their light hits you (if they pressed it)
Frame 14:  Your next move comes out (if you pressed another 5L)

Result: You get hit because they acted first (6f < 14f)
```

**Scenario 2: They do unsafe move (on block), they're -15**
```
[They press slow move] → [You block] → They're -15

Timeline:
Frame 0:   YOU can act
Frame 12:  Your 5L comes out (you started at frame 0)
Frame 15:  They can finally act (but too late!)

Result: Your 5L punishes them for FREE DAMAGE! ✅
```

---

## 🥊 When Do You Use 5L?

### ✅ GOOD Situations:

**1. As a Punish Starter**
```
Opponent does unsafe move on block (-12 or worse)
→ You press 5L (12f startup)
→ Hits them before they recover
→ Start your combo: 5L > 5L > 5S1 (Rocket Grab)
```

**2. After You Have Frame Advantage**
```
You hit them with Air Purifier (2S1) → You're +44!
→ You have 44 frames to do whatever you want
→ Walk up and press 5L
→ They can't press anything (you're way plus)
→ Start pressure: 5L > 5M > mixup
```

**3. As Your Fastest "Get Off Me" Move**
```
Opponent is pressuring you with blockstring
→ You see a gap in their attacks
→ Mash 5L (your fastest button at 12f)
→ If gap is >12f, your light interrupts them
→ You reset to neutral
```

**4. In Neutral, As a Quick Check**
```
Mid-range, both players neutral
→ You press 5L to see what they do
→ If they press a button: You might trade or win
→ If they block: You're only -2 (not horrible)
→ If they jump: You whiff (that's bad, but recoverable)
```

### ❌ BAD Situations:

**1. When You're Minus (Opponent Has Advantage)**
```
You blocked their safe move → They're +2
→ DON'T press 5L
→ They will hit you first
→ INSTEAD: Keep blocking or backdash
```

**2. At Long Range**
```
Opponent is far away
→ 5L is close range only
→ You'll whiff (miss completely)
→ They can Rocket Grab you during recovery
→ INSTEAD: Use 5S1 (Rocket Grab) or 2S1 (Air Purifier)
```

**3. Against Opponent Jumping**
```
They jump at you
→ 5L won't hit (they're in the air)
→ INSTEAD: Use 2S1 (Air Purifier) - your anti-air
```

**4. When They Have Armor**
```
They activated a super or armored move
→ Your 5L hits but doesn't stop them
→ They hit you through it
→ INSTEAD: Block and wait for armor to end
```

## 🚨 Dealing With Pressure: "I'm Being Locked Down!"

### The Problem:
```
Opponent keeps attacking you:
→ Crouching light (2L) spam
→ Grab mixup (throw or command grab)
→ Assist call to cover gaps
→ You're just blocking forever
→ Eventually you guess wrong and die
```

### Your Options (From Safest to Riskiest):

**1. Just Block (Safest)**
```
What: Hold back/down-back to block everything
When: When you don't know what to do
Why: Blocks all strikes (not grabs)
Risk: They can grab you
Reward: You stay safe

If they grab you: Press I (normal throw) to tech (counter) it
If they command grab: You have to jump or backdash BEFORE it comes out
```

**2. Parry (Medium Risk)**
```
What: Press U right before their attack hits
When: You read they'll attack (not grab)
Why: Parries their attack, gives YOU frame advantage
Risk: If you parry nothing, you're vulnerable
Reward: You get to attack first, turn the tables

Timing: Press U 6-10 frames before their hit
Success: Blue flash, you're now plus, press 5L to start YOUR turn
Failure: Parry animation whiffs, they hit you
```

**3. Mash Your Fastest Move (High Risk)**
```
What: Press 5L (12f) during gaps in their pressure
When: You see a gap >12 frames
Why: Interrupts their offense
Risk: If no gap exists, you get counter-hit
Reward: You interrupt, reset to neutral or start YOUR combo

How to find gaps:
- After they do 5L on block (-2), if they do another 5L (12f startup), there's a 14f gap
- After assists hit (usually +frames), there's NO gap
- After special moves on block, check frame data for gaps
```

**4. Reversal Special Move (Very High Risk)**
```
What: Do invincible move (super, if you have one)
When: Under extreme pressure, about to die
Why: Invincible moves go through attacks
Risk: If blocked, you're -20 or worse (full combo punish)
Reward: You escape pressure, might even hit them

Blitzcrank has NO true reversal ❌
- No invincible moves
- MUST use options 1-3 above
```

**5. Backdash (Medium Risk)**
```
What: Double-tap back (A A) to dash backward
When: They're in your face but not attacking yet
Why: Creates space, resets to neutral
Risk: Backdash has recovery frames, can be hit
Reward: Get out of corner, reset to your range (mid-range for Rocket Grab)

Good: After blocking their unsafe move
Bad: During their blockstring (you'll get hit)
```

**6. Jump (High Risk)**
```
What: Press W to jump backward or neutral
When: You read they'll do a grab or low attack
Why: Avoids grabs (can't grab airborne)
Risk: They anti-air you (2S1 or similar)
Reward: Escape grab mixup, might land a jump-in

Good: Against command grab attempts
Bad: Against good players who anti-air on reaction
```

## ⚡ Your Character's Fastest Moves (Frame Data)

### Blitzcrank's Speed Chart:

**Normal Attacks:**
```
5L: 12f - Fastest normal (standing light)
2L: 10f - FASTEST GROUND MOVE! (crouching light)
5M: 15f - Medium speed
5H: 18f - Slow
2M: 13f - Medium-fast (crouching)
j.L: 8f - Fast (jumping light)
```

**Special Moves:**
```
5S1 (Rocket Grab): 16f startup - Medium (projectile)
2S1 (Air Purifier): 23f startup - Slow BUT +44 on block!
2S2 (Command Grab): 6f - SUPER FAST but whiff = death
```

**Universal Moves:**
```
Normal Throw: 6f - VERY FAST (can't be blocked)
Parry: 6f - Active on frame 6
Dash: 12f recovery
Backdash: 15f recovery
```

### Your Best "Get Off Me" Tools:

**1. 2L (10f) - Your Fastest Ground Move**
```
Use when: Opponent has small gap in pressure
Startup: 10f (faster than 5L!)
On block: Usually -2 to -4
Pro: Fastest way to interrupt
Con: Low damage, must confirm into combo

Example:
Opponent: 5M on block (-6) → delays → presses 5M again (15f startup)
You: Press 2L (10f) in the gap
Result: Your 2L hits them before their 5M comes out!
```

**2. Normal Throw (6f) - Beat Their Blocking**
```
Use when: They're blocking a lot
Startup: 6f (VERY FAST)
Range: Close only
Pro: Can't be blocked, leads to combo
Con: Can be teched (if they also press throw)

Example:
Opponent: Keeps blocking your 5L
You: Walk up, press I (throw)
Result: Grab them, start combo
Counter: They press I at same time = throw tech (neutral)
```

**3. Parry (6f) - Read Their Attack**
```
Use when: You know they'll attack (not grab)
Active: Frame 6-10
Pro: Gives YOU frame advantage on success
Con: Loses to grabs, big recovery on whiff

Example:
Opponent: Always presses 5L after you block their 5L
You: Block first 5L → Parry (U) the second one
Result: Blue flash, you're plus, press 5L to punish!
```

**4. 2S1 Air Purifier (23f) - Your Safest Move**
```
Use when: You have space, reset to neutral
Startup: 23f (SLOW)
On block: +44 (SUPER SAFE!)
Pro: Even if blocked, you're massively plus
Con: Slow, can be interrupted before it comes out

Example:
Opponent: Doing pressure, you block
You: Find gap, do 2S1 (Air Purifier)
Result: Even blocked, you're +44, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN!
```

## 🎮 Mirror Match Gameplan (Blitzcrank vs Blitzcrank)

### Understanding the Mirror:
```
Both players have:
- Same health (1050)
- Same moves
- Same weaknesses
- Command grab (2S2) beats blocking
- Rocket Grab (5S1) controls space
- Air Purifier (2S1) +44 advantage
```

### Winning Strategy:

**Phase 1: Neutral Game (No One Touching)**

**Goal:** Hit Rocket Grab first, or get Air Purifier advantage

```
What to do:
1. Stay at mid-range
2. Throw Rocket Grab (5S1) repeatedly
3. If they jump → Air Purifier (2S1)
4. If your Rocket Grab hits → Dash forward, start combo
5. If they Rocket Grab you → You're pulled in, they get combo
6. Call assist to cover your Rocket Grabs

Key Rules:
- DON'T jump predictably (they'll Air Purifier you)
- DON'T walk forward carelessly (Rocket Grab pulls you)
- DO spam Air Purifier if they jump (you get +44!)
- DO use assists to make YOUR moves safe

Who wins neutral: Player who lands Rocket Grab or Air Purifier first
```

**Phase 2: Your Turn (You're Plus)**

**Scenario:** You landed Air Purifier (+44) or punished their whiff

```
What to do:
1. Walk up (they can't challenge, you're plus)
2. Call assist (Tag button)
3. Now do command grab mixup:

Option A: Command Grab (2S2)
- If they block: GRAB WINS! ✅
- If they jump: Grab whiffs, you're punished ❌

Option B: 5L or 2L
- If they jump: ATTACK WINS! ✅
- If they block: You're -2, but assist covers you

This is 50-50 mixup:
- They must guess: block or jump
- If they guess wrong: You win
- If they guess right: Reset to neutral
```

**Phase 3: Defense (They're Pressuring You)**

**Scenario:** They landed Air Purifier or Rocket Grab on you

```
What to do (in priority order):

1. BLOCK EVERYTHING (safest)
   - Hold back/down-back
   - Wait for them to do command grab

2. WHEN THEY CALL ASSIST + COMMAND GRAB:
   - Jump BEFORE grab comes out (6f)
   - Or backdash BEFORE grab
   - DON'T press buttons (grab will get you)

3. IF THEY DON'T HAVE ASSIST (on cooldown):
   - Command grab without assist = punishable
   - You can press 2L (10f) to interrupt
   - Or jump on reaction

4. PARRY THEIR NORMALS (risky)
   - If they press 5L, parry it (U)
   - You get frame advantage back
   - Loses to their command grab
```

**Phase 4: Assist Cooldowns (CRITICAL)**

**Assist cooldown = ~8-10 seconds** after use

```
If YOUR assist is on cooldown:
❌ Don't do command grab (too risky without assist)
✅ Use Rocket Grab to keep distance
✅ Use Air Purifier for frame advantage
✅ Play defensive until assist returns

If THEIR assist is on cooldown:
✅ Push forward aggressively
✅ Their command grab is unsafe (press 2L to beat it)
✅ They can't make unsafe moves safe
✅ This is YOUR window to attack!

How to track:
- Look at assist icon (grayed out = on cooldown)
- Count ~8 seconds after they use it
- Attack when you see it's unavailable
```

## 🔥 Advanced Mirror Match Tips

### Tip 1: Rocket Grab Wars
```
Problem: You both spam Rocket Grab (5S1)
Solution: Who shoots first AND hits wins

Counter-strategy:
- Jump over their Rocket Grab (read it)
- Land a jump-in combo
- Or use your own Rocket Grab in the air (j.S1)
```

### Tip 2: Air Purifier Priority
```
Problem: Both do Air Purifier at same time
Solution: Both get +44, return to neutral

Strategy:
- Don't both do it
- BAIT theirs (jump, make them whiff)
- Then punish their recovery
- Or do Rocket Grab while they're in animation
```

### Tip 3: Command Grab Mindgames
```
Problem: They keep blocking, waiting for your grab
Solution: Don't grab! Do 2L > 2M > 5S1 combo instead

Conditioning:
Round 1: Always command grab when plus
→ They learn to jump
Round 2: Start doing 5L when plus (catches their jump)
→ Now they don't know what to do!
```

### Tip 4: Corner Is Death
```
Problem: Got pushed to corner
Solution: MUST escape

How to escape:
1. Block until gap appears
2. Air Purifier (2S1) to reset (+44 even on block)
3. Use that +44 to walk out of corner
4. Or parry their attack, use advantage to dash out

DON'T:
- Jump (they'll anti-air you back into corner)
- Mash buttons (they're plus, you lose)
- Do unsafe moves (full combo punish)
```

### Tip 5: Life Lead Strategy
```
If you're winning (more health):
✅ Play defensive
✅ Spam Rocket Grab from far
✅ Don't take risks
✅ Make THEM come to you
✅ Run away the timer

If you're losing (less health):
❌ Can't play defensive
✅ MUST go in
✅ Take risks with command grab
✅ Use assists aggressively
✅ Force 50-50 mixups
```

## 📊 Quick Reference: Counter-Play Chart

### When Opponent Does This → You Do This:

| Opponent Action | Your Response | Why |
|----------------|---------------|-----|
| **Spam 2L (10f lights)** | Block → Find gap → 2L back | Their 2L is -2 to -4, gaps exist |
| **Command grab mixup** | Jump or backdash on read | Grabs can't hit airborne |
| **Block everything** | Walk up → Normal throw (I) | Throws beat blocking |
| **Jump a lot** | Air Purifier (2S1) | +44 on block, anti-air |
| **Rocket Grab spam** | Jump forward → j.M | Punish their whiff |
| **No assist available** | Attack aggressively | They can't make unsafe safe |
| **Plus frames on you** | Block → Wait → Counter | Don't press buttons when minus |
| **Corner pressure** | Block → Air Purifier (2S1) | +44 lets you escape |
| **Mash buttons** | Block → Punish with 5L > combo | Mashing is unsafe |

## 🎯 Summary: Frame Data in Practice

### Key Takeaways:

**1. Startup = How Fast**
- 12f = 0.2 seconds (5L)
- Lower is better
- Determines if you can punish or interrupt

**2. On Block = Who Goes First**
- +frames = You go first ✅
- -2 to -4 = Roughly even ⚖️
- -10 or worse = Free punish for them ❌

**3. Your Fastest Tools:**
- 2L (10f) - Fastest ground normal
- Throw (6f) - Fastest grab
- Parry (6f) - Fastest defense

**4. When Pressured:**
- Block (safest)
- Parry (risky read)
- Mash 2L (if gap exists)
- Jump (vs grabs only)
- Backdash (with space)

**5. Mirror Match = Mind Games:**
- Neutral: Rocket Grab wars
- Advantage: Command grab mixup
- Defense: Block + read
- Assist cooldowns = attack windows

**6. Frame Advantage Math:**
```
You do move (-2 on block) → You recover at frame 2
They press 6f move → Comes out at frame 6 (2+6=8 total)
You press 12f move → Comes out at frame 14 (2+12=14 total)
Result: Their move (8f) beats yours (14f)
```

**Remember:** Frame data is a tool, not a rulebook. Use it to make better decisions, but also trust your instincts and adapt to your opponent's patterns!

The best players combine frame knowledge with reads, reactions, and mind games. 🎮✨
