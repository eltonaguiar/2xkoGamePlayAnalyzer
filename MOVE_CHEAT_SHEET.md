---

## 📖 How to Read This Guide (For Beginners)

### Understanding Move Notation

Fighting games use **numpad notation** for directions (like a keyboard numpad):

```
7  8  9     [Back-Up]  [Up]      [Forward-Up]
4  5  6     [Back]     [Neutral] [Forward]
1  2  3     [Back-Down][Down]    [Forward-Down]
```

### What the Numbers and Letters Mean:
- **5** = Standing (no direction held)
- **2** = Crouching (holding down)
- **6** = Moving forward
- **j.** = Jumping (in the air)

### Button Names:
- **L** = Light attack (fast, low damage)
- **M** = Medium attack (balanced speed and damage)
- **H** = Heavy attack (slow, high damage)
- **S1** = Special move 1
- **S2** = Special move 2

### Examples:
- **5L** = Standing Light Punch (just press Light while standing)
- **2M** = Crouching Medium Kick (hold Down + press Medium)
- **j.H** = Jumping Heavy Attack (press Heavy while in the air)
- **5S1** = Standing Special 1 (Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab)

### Frame Data Explained Simply:
- **Startup**: How long before the move hits (lower is faster)
- **Recovery**: How long you're stuck after the move (lower is safer)
- **On Block**: What happens if opponent blocks
  - **Positive (+)**: You recover first = safe, you can attack again
  - **Negative (-)**: They recover first = unsafe, they can punish you
  - **Example**: +44 means you're SUPER safe! -2 means slightly unsafe

---

## Quick Reference: Move Safety

### ✅ SAFE MOVES (Can use freely)
- **2S1 (Air Purifier)**: +44 on block - Extremely safe!

### ⚠️ UNSAFE MOVES (High risk - use with caution)
- **5L (Light Punch)**: -2 on block

### 🔴 VERY UNSAFE (Only use in specific situations)

## Strategic Guidelines

### When to Use Assist

#### ALWAYS Use Assist For:
1. **2S2 (Garbage Collection)** - Command grab is risky, assist covers the mixup
2. **Whiffed Heavy Normals** - If you miss a big button, call assist to cover
3. **Unsafe Block Situations** - When your move is blocked and you're negative
4. **Mix-up Pressure** - To force opponent into blocking while you grab

#### Assist OPTIONAL For:
1. **5L (Light Punch)** - Only -2, can be made safe with cancel or spacing
2. **5S1 (Rocket Grab)** - Already decent at range, but assist makes it safer
3. **Combo Extensions** - For bigger damage

#### NEVER Need Assist For:
1. **2S1 (Air Purifier)** - Already +44 on block!

---

### Punishing Opponent Mistakes

#### If Opponent Whiffs Big Move (Long Recovery):
✅ **2S2 (Garbage Collection)** - FREE COMMAND GRAB!  
✅ **5S1 (Rocket Grab)** - Pull them in then combo  
✅ **Jump-in combo** - Maximum damage  
✅ **Your heaviest combo starter**

#### If Opponent is Jumping:
✅ **2S1 (Air Purifier)** - Anti-air grab (+44 on block!)  
✅ **j.S1 (Air Rocket Grab)** - Meet them in the air  
✅ **Any anti-air normal**

#### If Opponent is Blocking Too Much:
✅ **2S2 (Garbage Collection)** - Command grab beats block!  
✅ **Regular Throw** - Quick and easy  
⚠️ **Call assist first** - Makes grab safer

#### If Opponent is Very Minus (Blocked unsafe move):
✅ **Fastest normal into combo** - Guaranteed punish  
✅ **2S2 if close** - Command grab for big damage  
✅ **Super** - If you have meter, maximum damage

## Frame Advantage Quick Guide

### What Frame Advantage Means:
- **Positive (+)**: You recover first, you have advantage
- **Negative (-)**: Opponent recovers first, they have advantage
- **0**: Both recover at the same time (neutral)

### Frame Advantage Categories:
- **+10 or more**: HUGE advantage - guaranteed pressure or mixup
- **+1 to +9**: Good advantage - your turn to attack
- **0 to -2**: Slightly unsafe - can contest or retreat
- **-3 to -5**: Unsafe - opponent can attack
- **-6 or worse**: VERY UNSAFE - opponent gets full punish

### Blitzcrank's Frame Situations:
- **2S1 on block (+44)**: YOU GET FREE MIXUP! 🎉
- **5L on block (-2)**: Slightly unsafe, space it or cancel it

### Optimal Playstyle:
1. **Zone with Rocket Grab (5S1)** until opponent gets close
2. **Use 2S1 (Air Purifier)** as anti-air - you're +44 even if they block!
3. **Once close, mix between:**
   - Regular attacks (they can block)
   - Command grab (they cannot block)
4. **Use assists** to cover your mixups
5. **Don't spam command grab** - they'll jump and punish you

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DO NOT:
1. **Spam 2S2 (Command Grab) without setup** - Easy to jump/backdash
2. **Use command grab from far away** - Will whiff and get punished
3. **Forget to use 2S1 as anti-air** - It's +44, use it!
4. **Press buttons when you're minus** - Wait your turn
5. **Use big moves without assists** - Too risky alone

### ✅ DO:
1. **Use 5S1 (Rocket Grab) to control space** - Safe at range
2. **Call assist before command grab** - Covers the mix-up
3. **Use 2S1 against jumpers** - Pulls them down with frame advantage
4. **Condition with regular attacks first** - Then grab
5. **Pay attention to frame advantage** - Know when it's your turn

6. **50-50 is your win condition** - Mix strikes and grabs once close

**Remember**: This is a grappler archetype. Your goal is to get close and make opponents guess between blocking (which loses to grab) and jumping/attacking (which loses to your normals). Play patiently, zone with Rocket Grab, and strike when they make mistakes!
