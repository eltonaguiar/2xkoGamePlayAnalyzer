## 🎮 NOTATION GUIDE

**How to read fighting game notation:**

```
7  8  9     ↖ ↑ ↗    (Back-Up, Up, Forward-Up)
4  5  6     ← • →    (Back, Neutral, Forward)
1  2  3     ↙ ↓ ↘    (Back-Down, Down, Forward-Down)
```

**Think of it like a keyboard numpad!**

- **5** = Neutral (standing, no direction)
- **2** = Down (crouching)
- **6** = Forward
- **j.** = Jumping (in the air)

**Buttons:**
- **L/M/H** = Light/Medium/Heavy attack
- **S1/S2** = Special move 1/Special move 2

**Examples:**
- **5L** = Standing Light (just press L)
- **2S1** = Crouching Special 1 (hold Down + S1)
- **j.H** = Jumping Heavy (jump + press H)
