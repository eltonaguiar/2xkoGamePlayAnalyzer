STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

SAFE TO USE FREELY:
  - 2S1 (Air Purifier) - +44 on block, safest move
  - 5S1 (Rocket Grab) - Safe at range, controls space

REQUIRES ASSIST COVER:
  - 2S2 (Garbage Collection) - Command grab needs assist for mixup safety
  - Whiffed heavy normals - Call assist to cover recovery

ONLY ON OPPONENT MISTAKE:
  - 2S2 (Garbage Collection) without assist - Only if opponent whiffs big move
  - Raw command grab - Only after heavy conditioning or on hard read

ANTI-AIR OPTIONS:
  - 2S1 (Air Purifier) - Best option, +44 on block even if they land
  - j.S1 (Air Rocket Grab) - Air-to-air option

================================================================================
PUNISH OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================

WHEN OPPONENT WHIFFS:
  - 2S2 (Garbage Collection) - Free command grab
  - 5S1 (Rocket Grab) into combo
  - Jump-in full combo

WHEN OPPONENT BLOCKS TOO MUCH:
  - 2S2 (Garbage Collection) with assist
  - Regular throw

WHEN OPPONENT IS VERY MINUS:
  - Fastest normal into combo
  - 2S2 if close
  - Super if meter available

================================================================================
FRAME ADVANTAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

+10 or more: HUGE advantage - guaranteed pressure or mixup
+1 to +9: Good advantage - your turn to attack
0 to -2: Slightly unsafe - can contest or retreat
-3 to -5: Unsafe - opponent can attack
-6 or worse: VERY UNSAFE - opponent gets full punish
