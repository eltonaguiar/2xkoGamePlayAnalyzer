## 💡 What -2 On Block ACTUALLY Means

### THE SITUATION:
```
You press 5L → They block it → You're -2

TIMELINE:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Frame 0:   THEY can act first          │
│ Frame 2:   YOU can finally act         │
│ Frame 6:   Their 6f throw hits you     │
│ Frame 12:  Your next 5L comes out      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

RESULT: They hit you (6f < 12f)
```

### WHAT THEY CAN DO:
✅ Press fast moves (6-8f) - WILL hit you  
✅ Grab you (6f throw) - FREE  
✅ Command grab (if they have it)  
❌ Slow moves (15f+) - Too slow  
❌ Big combos - Not enough time  

### WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
✅ **BLOCK** (safest option)  
✅ Backdash (create space)  
⚠️ Press 2L (10f) - Risky, might trade  
❌ Press slow buttons - You WILL lose

## 🆚 Frame Comparison: -2 vs -10

║ ✅ Backdash                  ║ ❌ Too slow to escape        ║
║ ⚠️ Mash light (risky)       ║ ❌ Mashing = dead            ║

## 🥊 When To Use 5L

### ✅ GOOD SITUATIONS

**1. PUNISH STARTER**
```
Enemy: -12 or worse on block
You: Press 5L (12f startup)
Result: FREE HIT → 5L > 5L > 5S1 combo
```

**2. AFTER ADVANTAGE**
```
You: Hit Air Purifier (+44)
You: Walk up, press 5L
Result: They CAN'T challenge (you're way plus)
```

**3. INTERRUPT PRESSURE**
```
Enemy: Doing blockstring with gap
You: Mash 5L (12f)
Result: If gap >12f, you interrupt them
```

**4. FASTEST CHECK**
```
Neutral: Both waiting
You: Press 5L to poke
Result: Quick check, only -2 if blocked
```

### ❌ BAD SITUATIONS

**1. WHEN YOU'RE MINUS**
```
Enemy: +2 advantage
You: Press 5L
Result: They hit you first (LOSE)
```

**2. LONG RANGE**
```
Enemy: Far away
You: Press 5L (close range only)
Result: WHIFF, get punished
```

**3. VS JUMPERS**
```
Enemy: Jumping at you
You: Press 5L
Result: Misses (they're airborne)
Use: 2S1 (Air Purifier) instead
```

**4. VS ARMOR**
```
Enemy: Super armor active
You: Press 5L
Result: Hits but they don't flinch → You get hit
```

## ⚡ YOUR FASTEST MOVES (Speed Tier)

```
RANK  MOVE           STARTUP  USE CASE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1st   Throw (I)      6f      Beat blocking
1st   Parry (U)      6f      Read attack
2nd   2L (Crouch L)  10f     FASTEST normal
3rd   5L (Stand L)   12f     Punish, pressure
4th   2M (Crouch M)  13f     Low mixup
5th   5M (Stand M)   15f     Mid-range poke
```

**REMEMBER:**  
2L (10f) is FASTER than 5L (12f)!  
Use 2L to interrupt tighter gaps.

## 🎮 MIRROR MATCH CHEAT SHEET

### NEUTRAL GAME (Not Touching)
```
SPAM:    Rocket Grab (5S1) from mid-range
IF JUMP: Air Purifier (2S1) → +44 advantage
CALL:    Assist to cover your moves
GOAL:    Hit one clean Rocket Grab
```

### YOUR TURN (You're Plus)
```
WALK UP: Call assist
MIXUP:   Command Grab OR 5L
         → Block = Grab wins
         → Jump = 5L wins
50-50:   They must guess!
```

### THEIR TURN (You're Minus)
```
BLOCK:   Everything
WAIT:    For command grab attempt
THEN:    Jump BEFORE it connects
OR:      Backdash away
DON'T:   Press buttons (you'll lose)
```

### ASSIST TRACKING (Critical!)
```
THEIR ASSIST ON COOLDOWN (~8-10 sec):
✅ Push forward aggressively
✅ Their command grab is unsafe
✅ Press 2L to beat it
✅ THIS IS YOUR WINDOW!

YOUR ASSIST ON COOLDOWN:
❌ Don't do command grab
✅ Use Rocket Grab for safety
✅ Play defensive
❌ Don't take risks
```

## 📊 COUNTER-PLAY QUICK TABLE

```
IF OPPONENT DOES...          YOU DO...              WHY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Spam 2L (lights)            Block → 2L in gap       Find gaps
Command grab mixup          Jump/backdash           Can't grab air
Block everything            Normal throw (I)        Beats block
Jump a lot                  Air Purifier (2S1)      +44 advantage
Rocket Grab spam            Jump forward → j.M      Punish whiff
No assist available         ATTACK HARD             They're weak
Has frame advantage         BLOCK & WAIT            Don't challenge
Corner pressure             Air Purifier → escape   +44 = your turn
Mash buttons                Block → 5L punish       Unsafe mashing
```

## 🎯 FRAME MATH CHEAT SHEET

### FORMULA:
```
Your Recovery + Enemy Startup = Total Frames to Hit You

Example:
You: 5L blocked (-2)
Enemy: Presses 6f throw
Math: 2 + 6 = 8 frames until you're hit
Your next move: 5L (12f)
Math: 2 + 12 = 14 frames until YOUR move comes out
Result: 8 < 14 → Their throw beats your 5L
```

### CAN YOU PUNISH? CALCULATOR:
```
Enemy On Block: -15
Your Move Speed: 12f (5L)

If -15 ≥ 12f → YES, YOU CAN PUNISH ✅
If -15 < 12f → NO, TOO SLOW ❌

Examples:
-12 ≥ 12f? YES (exactly punishable)
-11 ≥ 12f? NO (too fast for you)
-20 ≥ 12f? YES (easily punishable)
```

---

## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS (Memorize These!)

### 1. FRAME = 1/60 Second
```
60 frames = 1 second
30 frames = 0.5 seconds
12 frames = 0.2 seconds (5L speed)
6 frames  = 0.1 seconds (throw speed)
```

### 2. PLUS = GOOD, MINUS = BAD
```
+44 = YOU'RE GOD MODE (Air Purifier)
+5  = Your turn to attack
0   = Even (neutral)
-2  = Their turn (5L on block) ← YOUR MOVE
-10 = You're getting comboed
```

### 3. STARTUP = SPEED
```
Lower number = Faster move = Better
12f = Medium speed (5L)
6f  = Very fast (throw, parry)
20f = Slow (reactable)
```

### 4. YOUR DEFENSE PRIORITY
```
1. BLOCK (safest, always works)
2. PARRY (risky, rewards skill)
3. MASH 2L (if gap exists)
4. JUMP (vs grabs only)
5. BACKDASH (need space)
```

### 5. ASSIST COOLDOWN = GAME CHANGER
```
WITH ASSIST:
- Command grab safe
- Unsafe moves safe
- Pressure is real

WITHOUT ASSIST:
- Everything risky
- Command grab punishable
- YOUR TIME TO ATTACK!

Track it: ~8-10 seconds cooldown
```

## 🏆 FINAL TIPS

**TIP 1:** Frame data guides decisions, not controls you. Read your opponent!

**TIP 2:** -2 is annoying but NOT death. Block and reset.

**TIP 3:** 2L (10f) is faster than 5L (12f). Use it for tight gaps!

**TIP 4:** Assist cooldown = ATTACK WINDOW. Punish them!

**TIP 5:** Mirror match = mind games + neutral control + mixups.

**TIP 6:** When minus, DON'T PRESS BUTTONS. Block and wait.

**TIP 7:** When plus (+44 Air Purifier), DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

**TIP 8:** Life lead = play safe. Life deficit = take risks.
